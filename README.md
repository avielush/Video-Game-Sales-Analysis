# Video-Game-Sales-Analysis
My final project at John Bryce College.

This dataset provides comprehensive sales information from Kaggle for video games in the years 1980-2020 across different platforms, genres, and regions. It includes data on global sales as well as sales by individual regions such as North America, Europe, and Japan. This dataset is valuable for analyzing trends in the video game industry, understanding the performance of different games across various regions, and identifying key factors that influence video game sales.
